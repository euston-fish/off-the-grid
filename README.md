## Prerequisites

Ensure you have `make`, `npm`, `unzip`, [`google-closure-compiler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-closure-compiler) and [`eslint`](https://eslint.org).

## Build

* To build the debug version with source maps, `make debug`
* To build the release version, `make release`

## Run

* To run the debug version with source maps, `make debug_run`
* To run the release version, `make release_run`

## Develop

Edit files under `src`.

## Todo

- Make build tools for compressing and measuring
- Maybe use less `make`
